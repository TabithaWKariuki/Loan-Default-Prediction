# Loan-Default-Prediction
## 1. Defining the Question
## a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question
Credit default risk is the risk that a lender takes the chance that a borrower fails to make required payments of the loan. The main purpose of this analysis is to predict whether a new customer can be a reliable customer. It's a way to avoid default and increase the bank’s revenue. This can be used to automate approving and declining loan applications more accurately.
## b) Defining the Metric for Success
Perform

Using the credit_risk_dataset_training.csv dataset analyse the data and visualize the most important aspects using your preferred method. 

Predict the outcome of a loan: is a customer likely to satisfy or default on the loan obligations? Use credit_risk_dataset_training.csv to train your model and
credit_risk_dataset_test.csv to predict the missing value (‘loan_status’).
